# M-circle

A visual experiment

- The why: I wanted to try out [the P5.js library](https://p5js.org/) and play around, making something visual, just for fun.
- The starting point: on an imaginary circle, draw a series of lines. Let each line rotate a little bit compared to the previous one. Play with different variables.
- The result: an interactive drawing that can be modified by the user, and has the potential to result in fascinating shapes.
